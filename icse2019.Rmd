This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
1+1
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
To view the HTML version, click on the *Knit* dropdown.

You can also add plain old Markdown chunks to show things like this typical `.gitignore` file, which excludes the history file and user settings used by RStudio:

```
.Rhistory
.Rproj.user
```
